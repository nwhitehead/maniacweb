Browsers need to be served the files, otherwise won't work due
to security policies.

Do this from web/ directory:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then open browser to localhost:8000 or whatever.

starlight js file must be named "starlight.js" because of script DOM
check, that's why it's in a directory with the full name I wanted to use.


IDEA:
maniac-web is a Node module (but really for browser)
do some build steps, get out "maniac-web/dist/*"
which includes single js file and a CSS file to include.

browserify
    generates one final js file
browserify-css
    loads all css into the main JS file, avoids different directories
browserify-shim
    lets us shim out windows globals like ace
